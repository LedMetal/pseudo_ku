# pseudo_ku
Minimalistic in design and powerful in strength, *pseudo_ku* is the ideal mobile game for the Sudoku fan!

## History
In the summer of '17, I (author of project) decided to create a Sudoku game while learning JavaScript. After writing the algorithms for creating a legal 9x9 Sudoku game as well as a game solver to verify the user's input, I decided to then move over to Unity and re-write the game in C#. I felt it would work better as a mobile game, rather than a web app.

I ended up finishing the app and I've had it on my phone for a long time. Unfortunately, I was not using any version control when working on the project. So now, I'm going to go through the project and make improvements to it as I work on it on this repository.

Feel free to download 'pseudo_ku.apk' (located in root folder), and try it out on your Android phone. I will keep this old build up until this project gets re-written enough for a build of its own.

## Current Build
You can access the current build [here]().

**NOTE**: The current build is the final build from the old project.

## Description
I always enjoyed Sudoku games, especially on mobile. However, I favour both minimalism and the ability to generate a random sudoku board on each run.

Enter *pseudo_ku*.

## Development
The two biggest parts of the creation of a Sudoku game are the puzzle builder and the solver. Both happened to be a lot more difficult than originally expected. Originally written in JavaScript then translated to C# for Unity, this project is currently being re-written with the intention of taking full advantage of version controlling the project.

## Built With
*Programming Language*: **C#**, **JavaScript**
